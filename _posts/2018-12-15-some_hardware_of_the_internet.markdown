## Nuts, Bolts, and Wire.
The internet is a wire.
Well, ok, its thousands (millions?) of wires that run all over the world, under the ocean, etc.
I have lots of wires in my house.  If I plug one into my computer, is that the internet?

Uhm, no.  Although, not terribly far off!

The "internet" wires are special only in that they really do connect to other computers (servers) they need to talk to.  And basically, they're all connected together, so the chit chat never stops.  It's the highway on which the traffic of information moves all the time.  The most important of these internet wires are called an `Internet Backbone` wire.  Internet Backbones are the heavy lifters for the internet, and are Serious, High-Speed, and very Secure pathways of the internet, usually owned and operated by governments, commercial or military entities.  

WAIT.  That sounds like my computer IS the internet!

Ahh yes.  No.  No, your computer is what is known as a `client`. The computers ON the internet are known as `servers`.  The only difference is that servers are connected **Directly** to the internet.  Your home computer is connected to an `ISP` (internet service provider) like AOL, Verizon, Optimum, etc.  That ISP acts as a middleman, and thus, your home computer is NOT the internet.

Web pages (like google.com, nytimes.com, greenpeace.org) are just files on a server computer.  No magic.  They're just regular html, css, javascript files like any you could write on your laptop with a terminal and a text editor.

Every server has a **unique** IP (internet protocol) address.  IP addresses usually look something like 192.168.1.1.  If you type that number into your address bar in a browser, it should load a page of some kind.  Give it a shot!  It probably will give you some kind of error messge, along with your ISP's logo.

## Sending your cat pics, or just an email
Whenever information is sent over the internet, the info is broken into small pieces called `packets`.  Once the packets reach their destination (your computer, or the recipient of your email's computer), the packets are brought together again, so that cute picture of Grumpy Cat isn't missing his tail or left ear.

## 60 Hudson Street, NYC
Would you like to see the Internet?  I mean, really, sort of, kind of, See the internet in action?
In you live in New York City, you're in luck!

Walk down to 60 Hudson Street, and take a good look at that building.  I'm paraphrasing here, but inside that building is one of the biggest, most important internet connections in the world.  I'm not kidding.  Over 1,000 telecommunications companies CONNECT to each other in that building, using some of the 70,000,000 feet of cabling present on location.  It's a gigantic *physical* hub of the internet.  There are a dozen or so other similar buildings in the world.  But, ya know, go take a look if you're in the neighborhood!
