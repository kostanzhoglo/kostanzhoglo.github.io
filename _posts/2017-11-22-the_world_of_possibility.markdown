I like quotes.  They can inspire you when you're down, give clarity when you're confused, and make you laugh or re-think some strongly held personal belief if they're worded well.  I search for good quotes, and do my best to hold onto the great ones, either by writing them in a notebook or committing them to memory if I have the headspace in that second.

Of course, many great quotes are cherished for a moment, an hour, and sometimes for a week before their wisdom is forgotten, and we've moved on to the hundreds of other concerns in our lives.  But in the funny way that life presents itself to you sometimes, you're at the right place to hear something, and realize that you need a change.  Something that had only been nagging at you subconsciously all of a sudden gets thrust into front-and-center, and you need to deal with it.  And a succinct quote can be that trigger.

Several days before coming across the phrase in question, I was being primed to receive it.  An old friend from high school posted on Facebook that she had just graduated from the Flatiron School.  I worked in the Flatiron district in New York City, so I checked out what this school was, just out of curiosity.  As it turns out, the school isn't located in the Flatiron district, but the computer coding aspect intrigued me!  

As a kid I was good at math, but I left that world behind when I decided to study acting at college and grad school.  Math homework always relaxed me in grade school, because there was always a correct answer.  Functions and operations didn't have semi-correct interpretations.  They either worked or didn't.  Certainly, math and logic could be frustrating when a problem seemed unsolvable, but with the right tools, and coming at it from the right angle and with enough patience, any problem can be figured out.  

Even still, seeing my friends graduation announcement, I pondered the idea of changing course for a few minutes that night, and then, promptly forgot about it, as the rest of life came pouring back in.  

And then, a few days later, I came across this quote, 
>              Live in the world of possibility.  Take consistent action. 

And immediately upon reading it, my brain went back to coding.  I knew right then that a change was needed.  I was excited, and curious.  I've always been up for learning something new.  And I've always known about myself that I like to build things.  I had left a life full of math and logic behind a long time ago (except for the random newspaper puzzle or brainteaser).  But the thrill I felt about this new avenue of study and opportunity couldn't be ignored.  I began looking into free tutorials and classes right away to test the waters.

Those two phrases above are easier said than done, of course.  There's lots of work ahead.  But the excitement is palpable, and the journey has begun.
